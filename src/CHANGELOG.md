## [2.0.1] - 2025-10-31 (Hotfix)

### üêõ Fixed

#### Cache Initialization Error
- **Issue:** `Failed to execute 'addAll' on 'Cache': Request failed`
- **Cause:** CacheManager tried to cache non-existent URLs (`/styles/globals.css`, etc.)
- **Solution:** 
  - Changed from `cache.addAll()` to individual `cache.put()` calls
  - Added error handling for each resource
  - Made caching non-blocking
  - Empty default cache list to prevent errors

**Files Modified:**
- `/utils/offlineSync.ts` - Rewrote `cacheResources()` method
- `/App.tsx` - Added error handling wrapper

**New Files:**
- `/utils/serviceWorker.ts` - Service Worker helpers
- `/OFFLINE_FUNCTIONALITY_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive offline guide

### üîß Changed

#### Improved Error Handling
```typescript
// Before (caused errors):
await cache.addAll(this.CACHE_URLS)

// After (resilient):
for (const url of this.CACHE_URLS) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url)
    if (response.ok) {
      await cache.put(url, response)
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn(`Failed to cache ${url}`)
  }
}
```

### üìö Documentation
- Added `/OFFLINE_FUNCTIONALITY_GUIDE.md` - Complete offline functionality guide
- Updated `/README.md` - Added recent updates section

### ‚úÖ Impact
